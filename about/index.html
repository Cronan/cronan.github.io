  <p>
    I'm a Principal Engineer and Head of Solutions Technology at
    <a href="https://www.man.com/">Man Group</a> in London. I lead the
    engineering function that powers Man Solutions' bespoke, multi-asset
    investment mandates - portfolio optimisation, mandate design, scenario
    analysis, client reporting - and the tools that help Solutions win
    new business.
  </p>

  <p>
    My remit is to make that work at scale, with clean architectures
    and tight collaboration between engineering, quant, investment,
    and client-facing teams.
  </p>

  <h2>What I focus on</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>AI deployment in regulated environments - designing systems where AI output can be observed, reversed, and enforced</li>
    <li>Engineering leadership - building teams that compound capability over years, not just ship features</li>
    <li>Risk and governance in technology - how to absorb errors cheaply, from any source, human or machine</li>
    <li>Portfolio construction and optimisation technology - the intersection of quant research and engineering</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I do</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Lead a team of software engineers delivering high-reliability systems for portfolio construction and analytics</li>
    <li>Own the technical strategy for Solutions Technology - architecture, tooling, standards, and delivery models</li>
    <li>Partner with quants and PMs to build optimisation frameworks used across mandates</li>
    <li>Build analytics and modelling tools that support sales pitches and new business</li>
    <li>Set engineering standards, CI/CD pipelines, observability, and long-term platform design</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>
    I grew up in Durban, South Africa, where I started programming as a boy
    on a Sinclair ZX81 - 1KB of RAM, a membrane keyboard, and BASIC. That
    was 1981. I've been writing code ever since.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before Man Group, I spent 25 years in quantitative analysis and
    financial technology:
  </p>

  <p>
    At Man Group I also spent several years in risk technology, building
    front-office risk systems and reporting. Combined with my earlier work
    on the quant team at GLG Partners, I have built systems across three
    domains that are usually siloed: quantitative research, risk, and
    client solutions.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Brevan Howard</strong> - front-office development, software architecture, team leadership</li>
    <li><strong>GLG Partners</strong> - senior member of the quant team, quantitative analysis and development</li>
    <li><strong>Merrill Lynch</strong> - financial technology</li>
    <li><strong>Barclays Capital</strong> - front-office systems</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I've worked mostly in C++, C#, Python, and distributed systems,
    with a particular interest in mathematics, portfolio construction,
    benchmarking, and optimisation.
  </p>

  <h2>What I'm focused on now</h2>

  <p>
    AI in production engineering - not the hype, but the reality of
    integrating AI coding assistants and agentic systems into teams
    that build financial software. The challenge isn't capability;
    it's designing systems and workflows where AI output can be trusted.
  </p>

  <h2>Beyond work</h2>

  <p>
    I live in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, with my wife Penelope. I play
    guitar. I started baking seriously during the
    COVID lockdowns and never stopped. I play chess. I'm interested in
    family genealogy - tracing both the Cronyn line (from Ó Cróinín
    in Ireland, through South Africa, to England) and Penelope's family.
