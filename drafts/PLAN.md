# Ivan Cronyn - Personal Brand & Presence Plan

Last updated: February 2026

## The Goal

Position Ivan Cronyn as Man Group's most senior and visible technologist. CTO-track. Deep technical credibility combined with strategic thinking about AI in production engineering.

## The Thesis

**"Trust, not capability"**: AI is a force multiplier only if the underlying system is designed to absorb mistakes cheaply. Observable, reversible, enforceable.

## The Voice

- British English (optimisation, colour, behaviour)
- First person, direct, no promotional language
- Acknowledges uncertainty ("I'm not sure. It's too early to know.")
- Technical depth but accessible
- Has opinions, not just neutral reporting

## What's Been Built

### cronyn.co.uk (live)
- Landing page with glitch headshot, career summary, essay links
- About page with clean headshot, full bio
- Three essays (strategic/CTO level):
  1. **Bainbridge's Ironies of Automation**: diagnosis, financial services risk
  2. **Trust, not capability**: strategy for technology organizations
  3. **Building engineers in the age of AI**: talent development
- Responsive design, dark mode, cache-busting

### Drafts ready (in /drafts/)
- `github-profile-readme.md`: content for Cronan/Cronan repo
- `ai-engineering-reading-list.md`: curated reading list structure
- `substack-profile.md`: Substack setup guide

## Lessons from Tech Leader Research

| Leader | Site | Key Insight |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Patrick Collison | patrickcollison.com | Minimal, interests-focused, no photo, just ideas |
| Paul Graham | paulgraham.com | Brutally plain, essays do all the work, Ctrl+F is search |
| Simon Willison | simonwillison.net | Prolific output, credits others, multiple content types |
| Julia Evans | jvns.ca | "Nobody cared about design if the posts were interesting" |
| Joel Spolsky | joelonsoftware.com | Plain design, built career through essays |
| Will Larson | lethain.com | Four books, posts weekly, blog IS his leadership platform |
| Charity Majors | charity.wtf | Sharp voice, coined "observability", NSFW authenticity |

**Common patterns:**
- Volume of writing matters
- Voice over design
- Show curiosity, not just expertise
- Lean into the geek (it IS the credibility)
- Have a referenceable point of view
