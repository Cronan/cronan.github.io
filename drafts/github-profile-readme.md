### Ivan Cronyn

Principal Engineer & Head of Solutions Technology at [Man Group](https://www.man.com/). I lead the engineering function for Man Solutions' bespoke investment mandates — portfolio optimisation, client reporting, and the tools that support new business.

I've been writing code since 1981, starting on a Sinclair ZX81 in Durban, South Africa. Career path: Barclays Capital → Merrill Lynch → GLG Partners → Brevan Howard → Man Group. Mostly C++, C#, and Python.

Right now I'm thinking about how AI is changing the way we build and maintain financial software. The capability is impressive. The bottleneck is trust.

**Writing:**
- [Trust, not capability](https://cronyn.co.uk/writing/trust-not-capability.html) — the real constraint on AI in production engineering
- [Building engineers in the age of AI](https://cronyn.co.uk/writing/ai-as-junior-engineer.html) — talent development when AI does the reps
- [Bainbridge's Ironies of Automation](https://cronyn.co.uk/writing/ironies-of-automation.html) — a 1983 paper that maps precisely onto today

## Notes on this draft

**What it does:**
- Full title (Head of Solutions Technology) establishes seniority
- Man Group link shows you're not hiding employer
- ZX81 line shows depth of experience, keeps the "still geeky" credibility
- Career path is one line, not a CV
- "Right now I'm thinking about" is active and current, not a static bio
- "The capability is impressive. The bottleneck is trust." — thesis in two sentences
- Essay links with one-line descriptions (not just titles)
- Clean footer with site and LinkedIn

**What it avoids:**
- No "passionate about" or "committed to"
- No list of technologies or skills
- No promotional language
- No photo (GitHub handles that separately)
- Not too long — should fit without scrolling

**Voice check:**
- First person ✓
- Direct ✓
- Acknowledges real work (portfolio optimisation, client reporting) ✓
- Technical credibility (ZX81, C++/C#/Python) without being a skills list ✓
- British spelling (optimisation) ✓
