# Substack Profile Setup

## Username
First choice: `cronyn`
Backup: `ivancronyn`

## Display Name
Ivan Cronyn

## Profile Photo
Use the clean headshot (ivan-headshot.jpg), not the glitched one. The glitch works for the personal site's tech aesthetic but would look odd on Substack where people expect a normal photo.

## Bio (short version for profile)

> Principal Engineer & Head of Solutions Technology at Man Group. Writing about AI in production engineering — the gap between capability and trust.

## Bio (longer version for About page)

> I lead Solutions Technology at Man Group, managing the engineering function for bespoke investment mandates. Before Man Group, I spent 25 years in front-office technology across Brevan Howard, GLG Partners, Merrill Lynch, and Barclays Capital.
>
> I've been writing code since 1981, on a Sinclair ZX81 in Durban, South Africa.
>
> This newsletter is about AI in production engineering. Not the hype, not the doom — the practical question of how we integrate AI into systems that handle real money and real consequences. The capability is impressive. The bottleneck is trust.
>
> I also write at [cronyn.co.uk](https://cronyn.co.uk).

## Publication Name

Option 1: **Ivan Cronyn** (recommended)
Your name is the brand. Keep it simple. This is what Patrick Collison, Paul Graham, and Simon Willison do.

Option 2: **Trust, Not Capability**
Ties to your thesis, but may be too narrow if your writing expands.

Option 3: **Engineering at Scale**
Too generic. Avoid.

## Tagline

> AI in production engineering. The practical questions.

Or simply:

> Writing about AI, trust, and building engineering capability.

## Settings

- **Posting frequency:** Don't commit to a schedule you can't keep. "Occasional essays" is fine.
- **Comments:** Enable. You want engagement.
- **Recommendations:** Turn on. Let Substack recommend you to others.
- **Cross-posting:** When you publish an essay on the site, post it to Substack with a note: "Originally published at cronyn.co.uk"

## First Post

Don't start with a "welcome to my newsletter" post. Start with your strongest essay. I'd suggest the Trust essay — it's the clearest statement of your thesis.

Title it the same as on your site. Add a short intro paragraph for Substack readers who don't know you:

> *I'm Ivan Cronyn, a Principal Engineer at Man Group. This essay was originally published at [cronyn.co.uk](https://cronyn.co.uk). I'm starting a newsletter to share my writing on AI in production engineering.*

Then the essay body.
