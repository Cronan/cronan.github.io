  <p>
    A curated reading list on AI in production engineering. The bottleneck
    isn't capability - it's trust. We can build AI systems that perform; we
    struggle to build systems we can verify, understand, and safely operate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Three paths through the material:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Bainbridge trail</strong> - Why automation creates the problems it was meant to solve. The foundation for everything else.</li>
    <li><strong>The trust trail</strong> - Building systems you can verify. The framework for operational trust.</li>
    <li><strong>The people trail</strong> - How AI changes the way engineers develop expertise.</li>
  </ul>
