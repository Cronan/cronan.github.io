  <p>
    A curated reading list on AI in production engineering. Not comprehensive.
    These are the papers, posts, and talks that have shaped how I think about
    the problem.
  </p>

  <h2>The foundational problem</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Lisanne Bainbridge,
    <a href="https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bainbridge_1satisficer983_Ironies-of-front.pdf">Ironies of Automation</a></strong>
    (1983)
  </p>
  <p>
    Written about industrial process control, but maps precisely onto AI-assisted
    software development. The core insight: the more advanced the automation, the
    more critical the human contribution, and the less likely humans are able to
    provide it. If you read one thing on this list, read this.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Gary Klein,
    <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262534291/sources-of-power/">Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions</a></strong>
    (1998)
  </p>
  <p>
    How experts actually make decisions under pressure. Not through analysis,
    but through pattern recognition built from experience. Relevant because AI
    changes how engineers build that pattern recognition.
  </p>

  <h2>Trust and verification</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Leslie Lamport,
    <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf">Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System</a></strong>
    (1978)
  </p>
  <p>
    Not about AI, but about the fundamental problem of knowing what happened
    and in what order. Relevant to any system where you need to understand
    and audit automated behaviour.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Charity Majors,
    <a href="https://info.honeycomb.io/observability-engineering-oreilly-book-2022">Observability Engineering</a></strong>
    (2022)
  </p>
  <p>
    The practical guide to building systems you can actually understand in
    production. The "observable" in "observable, reversible, enforceable"
    owes a lot to this.
  </p>

  <h2>AI in practice</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Simon Willison,
    <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">simonwillison.net</a></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Nobody documents their AI usage more thoroughly. His TILs and link blog
    are a running record of what works and what doesn't. Worth following.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Andrej Karpathy,
    <a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a></strong>
    (2017)
  </p>
  <p>
    The framing that code is being replaced by data. Written before LLMs,
    but sets up the question: if the code writes itself, what does the
    programmer do?
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Dan McKinley,
    <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose Boring Technology</a></strong>
    (2015)
  </p>
  <p>
    Not about AI, but about the cost of novelty. Useful counterweight when
    everyone wants to adopt the latest model.
  </p>

  <h2>Financial services context</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Andrew Haldane,
    <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2012/the-dog-and-the-frisbee">The Dog and the Frisbee</a></strong>
    (2012)
  </p>
  <p>
    Bank of England speech on complexity in financial regulation. The argument:
    simple rules often outperform complex models. Relevant to thinking about
    where AI helps and where it doesn't.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Man Group Research,
    <a href="https://www.man.com/maninstitute/">Machine Learning Papers</a></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Oxford-Man Institute publishes good work on machine learning in finance.
    Worth browsing.
