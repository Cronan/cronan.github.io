  <p>
    I speak about AI deployment in production, engineering leadership, and
    the trust infrastructure that financial systems need before they can
    absorb AI's mistakes cheaply. The perspective comes from building these
    systems, not studying them from outside.
  </p>

  <h2>Topics</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Trust, not capability: what production AI actually needs</strong><br>
      <small>The bottleneck in AI adoption is not model quality but whether
      your systems can observe, reverse, and enforce AI output. Drawn from
      building AI-integrated systems inside a regulated financial firm.</small>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ten paradigm shifts: what 45 years of programming teaches you about AI</strong><br>
      <small>From ZX81 BASIC in 1981 to AI agents in 2026. Pattern recognition
      across every major technology transition. What the previous nine shifts
      tell us about this one.</small>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bainbridge's ironies, forty years on</strong><br>
      <small>A 1983 paper about factory automation predicted the exact problems
      we now face with AI coding assistants. What it means for how we build
      teams and protect the cognitive work that matters.</small>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The suspicion tax: when AI erodes trust faster than it creates value</strong><br>
      <small>Why self-reported AI productivity gains are structurally unreliable,
      what to measure instead, and why the organisations that get measurement
      right will compound the advantage.</small>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Building engineers when AI writes the code</strong><br>
      <small>Junior developer training in the age of AI. What skills still
      matter, what formative work looks like now, and why optimising for
      today's velocity breaks tomorrow's capability.</small>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Formats</h2>

  <p>
    Keynote, panel, fireside chat. I am comfortable with unscripted formats
    and extended audience Q&amp;A.

  <h2>Bio</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Short (50 words):</strong> Ivan Cronyn is a Principal Engineer and
    Head of Solutions Technology at a major London hedge fund, where he leads
    engineering for bespoke investment mandates. He has spent 27 years building
    financial systems across risk, quant, and client technology, and writes
    about AI deployment in regulated environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Long (150 words):</strong> Ivan Cronyn leads engineering for bespoke
    investment mandates at one of the world's largest alternative investment
    managers in London. Over 27 years in financial technology - at Barclays
    Capital, Merrill Lynch, GLG Partners, Brevan Howard, and his current firm -
    he has built systems across risk technology, quantitative research, and
    solutions engineering: the full lifecycle from signal generation through
    risk management to client delivery. He has programmed since 1981, starting
    on a Sinclair ZX81 in Durban, South Africa, and has built production systems
    through every major paradigm shift from structured programming to AI agents.
    His writing argues that trust, not capability, is the real bottleneck in
    AI-assisted engineering - that the models are good enough, but systems must
    be designed to absorb their mistakes cheaply.
