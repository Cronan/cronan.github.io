    <p>
      How do we build the next generation of senior engineers if AI does
      the work that used to train them?
    </p>

    <p>
      Junior engineers used to spend their first years writing boilerplate,
      fixing small bugs, and slowly building mental models of how systems
      fit together. That work wasn't exciting, but it was formative. You
      learned the codebase by touching it. You developed intuition by
      making mistakes and cleaning them up. The reps mattered.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI changes this. A junior engineer with Claude can produce working
      code faster than they can understand it. The output looks fine. The
      tests pass. But the understanding that used to come from writing
      that code - the hard-won intuition about why things are shaped the
      way they are - where does that come from now?
    </p>

    <h2>The productivity trap</h2>

    <p>
      Every team I've worked with runs the same cycle:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Everyone moves faster at first</li>
      <li>Code review friction spikes</li>
      <li>Senior engineers start slowing things down</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The seniors aren't being obstructionist. They're the ones who'll be
      on call when the system breaks on a Sunday night. They need to trust that the
      code can be understood, debugged, and fixed under pressure. When PRs
      get bigger and context gets thinner, that trust erodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The deeper problem: if we optimise purely for velocity, we stop
      investing in the skills that create good senior engineers. We trade
      tomorrow's capability for today's throughput.
    </p>

    <h2>What we still need engineers to learn</h2>

    <p>
      Some skills matter more than ever. System reasoning, for one:
      understanding how components interact, where the failure modes are,
      what happens when assumptions break. You don't get this from reading
      code. You get it from building and debugging systems over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then there's judgment under uncertainty. Knowing when to be cautious
      and when to move fast. Recognising when a change is safe and when
      it's risky. This is pattern recognition built from experience, not
      something you can prompt for.
    </p>

    <p>
      And being able to explain why the system works this way, not just
      what it does. That matters for code review, for onboarding, and for
      debugging production incidents when nobody has time to reverse-engineer
      the original intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      None of these come from generating code faster. They come from
      wrestling with hard problems over time.
    </p>

    <h2>A different approach to AI-assisted development</h2>

    <p>
      I've been mentoring an early-career engineer who's strong with
      Claude Code but has no deep infrastructure background. Instead of
      chasing agentic abstractions, we focused on three things:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Incremental refactors, not wholesale rewrites</li>
      <li>PR descriptions that explain why a change is safe</li>
      <li>Letting CI enforce the boundaries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The incremental refactor point matters most. AI is happy to rewrite
      an entire module if you ask. The output might even be better. But a
      500-line diff that changes the structure of a module is impossible
      to review with confidence. A 30-line diff that extracts one function
      is easy to review, easy to test, easy to revert.
    </p>

    <p>
      More importantly, breaking work into small pieces forces the engineer
      to understand each piece. The AI handles the typing. The human makes
      the decisions about what to change and why. The skill-building happens
      in the decision-making, not the implementation.
    </p>

    <h2>The organisational question</h2>

    <p>
      This matters beyond individual mentoring. Technology organisations
      need to think about where their future senior engineers will come
      from.
    </p>

    <p>
      If AI handles all the work that used to build foundational skills,
      we need to be deliberate about creating other paths to expertise.
      That might mean:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Pairing junior engineers with seniors on debugging and incident
          response, not just feature work</li>
      <li>Requiring engineers to explain their AI-generated code in
          reviews, not just submit it</li>
      <li>Rotating people through on-call and support roles where they
          have to understand systems they didn't build</li>
      <li>Investing in architecture discussions and design reviews, even
          when "just ship it" feels faster</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I'm not arguing for nostalgia. Expertise doesn't appear by magic.
      It's built through specific kinds of work. If AI changes what
      junior work looks like, we need to consciously create the
      conditions for expertise to develop.
    </p>

    <h2>Five years from now</h2>

    <p>
      The question I ask myself: in five years, who will diagnose the
      production incident when the pager goes off? Who will understand
      why the system is designed the way it is? Who will make the
      judgment call about whether a risky migration is safe to proceed?
    </p>

    <p>
      If we spend those five years maximising AI-assisted throughput
      without investing in skill development, we'll have a team that
      can generate code but can't reason about systems. That's a bad
      trade.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI doesn't replace engineering judgment. It changes how we
      build it. The organisations that get this right will compound the
      advantage over years. The ones that don't will wake up with a team
      that can generate code but can't diagnose why the system broke.
