      AI productivity gains are real — but only if the output can be trusted.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've seen a lot of teams adopt AI-assisted coding over the last few
      months, and the pattern is fairly consistent:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Everyone moves faster at first</li>
      <li>Code review friction spikes</li>
      <li>Senior engineers quietly try to slow things down again</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The teams that actually keep the productivity gains do one thing
      differently: they treat AI output like junior engineer output — small
      diffs, explicit intent, and automated checks.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been mentoring an early-career engineer with strong Claude Code
      experience but no deep infrastructure background. Instead of chasing
      agentic abstractions, we focused on three "boring" skills:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using Claude to produce incremental refactors, not wholesale rewrites</li>
      <li>Writing PR descriptions that explain <em>why</em> a change is safe</li>
      <li>Letting CI enforce the boundaries — tests, coverage, file-scope rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The result wasn't flashy — but it meant the output could be trusted,
      which is what actually matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's a useful reminder that AI doesn't replace engineering discipline —
      it amplifies whatever discipline is already there.
    </p>
